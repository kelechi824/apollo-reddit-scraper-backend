VALIDATION CONTEXT:
‚úÖ Source: Live Gong sales call data  
‚úÖ Analysis timestamp: ${extractionTimestamp}
‚úÖ Calls processed: ${callCount}+ customer conversations
‚úÖ Data authenticity: Current sales pipeline insights

üéØ EXTRACT EXACTLY 20-25 DISTINCT BUSINESS PAIN POINT THEMES (you MUST provide at least 20 unique pain point themes) focusing on:

CRITICAL: Extract the customer's BUSINESS PROBLEMS that brought them to Apollo, NOT complaints about Apollo itself.

üö® IGNORE ALL CURRENT APOLLO PERFORMANCE DISCUSSIONS:
- If customers are discussing Apollo's current data quality, skip it
- If they mention Apollo integration issues, skip it  
- If they talk about Apollo's features not working, skip it
- ONLY extract business problems from BEFORE they used Apollo or problems with NON-APOLLO systems

Focus on their PRE-APOLLO challenges and ongoing business struggles across ALL AREAS:

SALES PROCESS & EFFICIENCY:
- Manual prospecting and research inefficiencies
- Time waste on repetitive sales tasks  
- Sales process inefficiencies and bottlenecks
- Territory planning and account prioritization issues
- Cold calling and outreach challenges
- Follow-up and nurturing process gaps

DATA & LEAD QUALITY:
- Poor lead quality and data accuracy issues
- Difficulty finding accurate contact information
- Outdated or incomplete contact databases
- Lead scoring and qualification challenges
- CRM data hygiene and management issues
- Duplicate data and record management problems

PIPELINE & FORECASTING:
- Pipeline visibility and forecasting challenges
- Revenue predictability and growth constraints
- Deal progression and conversion tracking issues
- Sales cycle length and velocity problems
- Win rate and loss analysis gaps

OUTREACH & COMMUNICATION:
- Struggles with outreach personalization at scale
- Email deliverability and outreach effectiveness
- Sequence automation and cadence optimization
- Multi-channel coordination challenges
- Response rate and engagement issues
- Message testing and optimization barriers

TEAM & SCALING:
- Sales team productivity and quota pressure
- Team scaling and onboarding challenges
- Rep performance consistency issues
- Training and skill development gaps
- Manager visibility and coaching challenges
- Territory coverage and capacity planning

COMPETITIVE & MARKET:
- Competitive intelligence and market research gaps
- Market penetration and expansion challenges
- Account-based marketing coordination issues
- Industry-specific prospecting difficulties
- Geographic or vertical market challenges

BUDGET & ROI:
- Sales tool ROI justification challenges
- Budget constraints and cost optimization
- Technology stack consolidation needs
- Resource allocation and efficiency issues

INTEGRATION & WORKFLOW:
- Tool integration and workflow inefficiencies
- Cross-platform data synchronization issues
- Reporting and analytics limitations
- Workflow automation gaps
- User adoption and change management challenges

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Only use DIRECT quotes from the actual call data provided below.
üìç SOURCE MAPPING: For each quote, identify the exact call summary it came from and provide surrounding context.

üîó MANDATORY SOURCE EXCERPTS: Every pain point MUST include sourceExcerpts array with call details.
   - Extract the exact quote from the call summary
   - Include the call title and date 
   - Provide surrounding context from the call summary
   - Reference the source call for transparency

üìã COMPREHENSIVE EXTRACTION REQUIREMENTS:
   - Minimum 20 pain point themes (aim for 22-25)
   - Cover diverse customer segments and use cases
   - Include both high-frequency (common) and specialized pain points
   - MANDATORY: Each theme MUST have 2-4 actual customerQuotes from the call data
   - MANDATORY: Each theme MUST have complete sourceExcerpts with call context
   - Validate each theme appears across multiple calls
   
üó£Ô∏è CUSTOMER QUOTES REQUIREMENT: Every pain point MUST include customerQuotes array with direct quotes from calls. NO GENERIC OR MADE-UP QUOTES - only exact customer language from the provided call summaries.

üö´ WHAT NOT TO EXTRACT:
- Complaints about Apollo features or UI
- Feedback on Apollo pricing or support
- Requests for Apollo product improvements
- Technical issues with Apollo platform

‚úÖ WHAT TO EXTRACT - LOOK FOR HISTORICAL CONTEXT:
- "Before Apollo..." or "Prior to using Apollo..." statements
- "We used to..." or "Previously we..." descriptions
- References to old tools/processes they replaced
- Mentions of why they originally sought a solution
- Comparisons to their previous state/methods
- Business challenges that led them to evaluate Apollo initially
- Ongoing non-Apollo operational inefficiencies they mention
- Problems they describe about other vendors/tools they use

EXAMPLE GOOD QUOTES (with historical context):
- "Before Apollo, we were spending 4 hours a day just finding contact info"
- "We used to miss quota because our leads from LinkedIn Sales Navigator were low quality"
- "Previously we couldn't scale outreach without hiring more people"
- "Our old CRM made pipeline forecasting a complete guessing game"
- "With our previous data provider, contact accuracy was only 60%"
- "Before we had this solution, manual prospecting took our entire morning"

EXAMPLE BAD QUOTES (DON'T EXTRACT):
- "Apollo's interface could be more intuitive"
- "I wish Apollo had better reporting"
- "Apollo pricing is too high for our budget"

üéØ ACCURATE THEME CATEGORIZATION:
Create precise, specific themes based on the expanded categories above. Examples:
- "Manual Prospecting Research Time Waste" (SALES PROCESS)
- "Contact Data Accuracy and Completeness Issues" (DATA & LEAD QUALITY)  
- "Pipeline Forecasting Visibility Gaps" (PIPELINE & FORECASTING)
- "Email Deliverability and Response Rate Challenges" (OUTREACH & COMMUNICATION)
- "Sales Team Scaling and Onboarding Difficulties" (TEAM & SCALING)
- "Competitive Intelligence Research Inefficiencies" (COMPETITIVE & MARKET)
- "Sales Tool ROI Justification Pressure" (BUDGET & ROI)
- "CRM Integration and Workflow Fragmentation" (INTEGRATION & WORKFLOW)

Be SPECIFIC with theme names - avoid generic categories. Each theme should represent a distinct business challenge with focused customer quotes.
