CONTENT VALIDATION CHECKLIST:

Before finalizing, ensure:
1. ✓ Article is COMPLETE with proper conclusion within target word count
2. ✓ Strong conclusion with clear takeaways and actionable next steps
3. ✓ All competitor topics are covered and enhanced appropriately for the length
4. ✓ Unique research insights are integrated efficiently
5. ✓ Content gaps are addressed within the word limit constraints
